# DRO → tulip: first results (2026-07-31)

Goal cell: **direct / min-time** — the twin of `pumpkyn.cr3bp.tfMin`. Chosen
first because DRO→tulip is the only problem in the catalog where an
independently converged *indirect* solution already exists, so it is the one
place the direct method can be checked against a second opinion.

## The transfer, characterized from the reference solution

| | |
|---|---|
| t_f | 4.015242 ND = 17.798 days |
| revolutions about the Moon | **1.18** |
| Earth distance | 0.8535 – 1.1122 (never approaches Earth) |
| closest lunar approach | **0.0164 ND ≈ 4650 km altitude** |
| mass fraction | 1.0 → 0.918692 |

**No Sundman regularization is needed**, and that is a measured conclusion, not
an assumption: at 1.18 revolutions with no Earth passage, the stiffness that
forces regularization in GTO→tulip (a ~40-rev spiral through deep perigee)
simply is not present. Plain time-domain collocation is the right tool here.

## The direct formulation

Normalized time `s ∈ [0,1]`, `dX/ds = t_f·f(X,U)`, state `[r;v;m]`, control
`[alpha;thr]`, minimize `t_f`. Dynamics mirror `tfMinEoM` line for line.

**`t_f` had to be LIFTED.** A single scalar `t_f` couples to every defect,
giving one dense KKT column — and MUMPS does not survive it. The first version
killed MATLAB with a fatal error immediately after IPOPT printed the Jacobian
structure, at only N = 400. This is the same failure the tulip solver sidesteps
by fixing `tau_f` and the earth CR3BP campaign cured with `liftDL`. Replicating
`t_f` per node with local continuity (`T(k+1) = T(k)`) makes the arrowhead
banded; the solution is unchanged and the solve takes 6.8 s.

**Throttle left free, and it saturates.** `min(thr) = 1.000000` across the
trajectory, confirming the min-time bang-at-the-bound structure rather than
assuming it. Worth noting the reference *permits* a switch —
`tfMinEoM` sets `u = 0` when `S = -||lambda_v||c/m - lambda_m > 0` — but in the
converged solution `lambda_m` runs 5.50 → 0 while staying positive, so `S < 0`
throughout.

## THE RESULT: min-time here is not unique, and the reference is not the fastest

Solutions are machine-tight (defect 1e-14 to 1e-16, terminal error 0) but depend
strongly and non-monotonically on the mesh:

| N | t_f | vs reference | closest lunar approach |
|---|---|---|---|
| 400 | 4.143868 | +3.2% | 0.01682 (4819 km) |
| **800** | **3.881410** | **−3.3%** | **0.00559 (442 km)** |
| 1600 | 7.253098 | +80.6% | 0.01645 (4674 km) |
| *reference (indirect)* | *4.015243* | — | *0.0164 (4650 km)* |

**The N = 800 solution is faster than the reference minimum.** That is only
possible if the reference is a local, not global, minimum — and the mechanism is
visible in the last column: it buys speed with a far deeper lunar gravity
assist, 442 km altitude against 4650 km.

**So the problem as posed is ill-posed.** With no minimum-altitude path
constraint, solutions can approach the Moon arbitrarily closely, and "the
minimum time" is not well defined — it is a family parameterized by flyby
altitude, bounded only by the lunar surface. The indirect method never exposed
this because shooting cannot reach those solutions from a reasonable seed.

This is **basin multiplicity in a third independent context**, after min-fuel
GTO→tulip (six optima at one t_f) and min-fuel earth (every certified row
beaten). It is not a min-fuel phenomenon.

## What must be checked before any of this is claimed

**Whether the 442 km solution is genuinely feasible or is exploiting the
discretization.** A direct method can "cut the corner" at a close approach if
the mesh is too coarse to resolve it — the trajectory between nodes is never
evaluated. The test is to reconstruct the control and propagate it with a
high-accuracy integrator, which is exactly what `verify_common/pmp/` does. If
the propagated trajectory does not reproduce the nodes, the fast solution is an
artifact and the finding is about mesh adequacy instead.

Until that runs, the honest statement is: *the direct formulation converges
machine-tight to solutions that undercut the reference by exploiting closer
lunar flybys; whether those are physical is unverified.*

## Next

1. **Propagation check** on the N = 800 solution (above).
2. **Add a minimum lunar altitude path constraint** and re-run the N sweep. With
   the problem well-posed, the N-dependence should collapse.
3. Then the cell this was built for: **compare the direct duals against the
   indirect costates** via the Hager covector mapping — the cross-validation the
   repo has never been able to do.
